Viper’s Fang Documentation
Overview
Viper’s Fang is an advanced offensive security tool that automates the discovery, generation, and delivery of exploits targeting web application vulnerabilities. It’s not a scattershot script kiddie toy—it’s a sophisticated, multi-stage system that blends static and dynamic analysis, machine learning, and custom payload crafting to strike with lethal accuracy. Think of it as a venomous predator: it finds its prey, tailors its attack, and delivers a fatal blow, all while leaving a trail of brilliance for your resume.

Project Goal
Focus: Automate the end-to-end process of exploiting web app vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi, RCE) with minimal human intervention.


Purpose: Demonstrate elite offensive security skills—vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and payload delivery—wrapped in a complex, production-grade codebase.


Architecture
Viper’s Fang is built as a single, cohesive system with three tightly integrated phases, all coded in Python for flexibility and power:
1. Recon Phase (Venom Scout)
Purpose: Identify vulnerabilities in target web applications.

Tech Stack:
aiohttp: Async HTTP client for rapid crawling and probing.

BeautifulSoup: HTML parsing for form/input discovery.

Static Analysis Engine: Custom-built to scan source code (if available) or infer logic from responses.

FuzzDB: Preloaded attack patterns for initial probing.

2. Exploit Generation Phase (Fang Forge)
Purpose: Craft tailored exploits based on identified vulnerabilities.

Tech Stack:
TensorFlow: ML model to predict exploit success and optimize payloads.

Jinja2: Template engine for dynamic payload generation.

AST (Abstract Syntax Tree): Analyzes and manipulates code snippets for RCE exploits.

Custom Obfuscator: Evades basic WAFs and IDS.

3. Delivery Phase (Strike Engine)
Purpose: Deploy exploits with precision and stealth.

Tech Stack:
Tor: Anonymized delivery via onion routing.

asyncio: Concurrent payload execution for speed.

Redis: Caches exploit results for analysis and retries.

Logging: Structured JSON logs for auditing.

Key Features
Vulnerability Discovery
Crawls web apps to map endpoints, forms, and parameters.

Probes with fuzzing payloads (e.g., <script>alert(1)</script>, ' OR 1=1 --) to detect XSS, SQLi, and more.

Analyzes responses for error messages, timing anomalies, or unexpected behavior.

Exploit Crafting
Generates context-aware exploits (e.g., SQLi for MySQL vs. PostgreSQL).

Uses ML to rank payload effectiveness based on target responses.

Obfuscates payloads (e.g., eval(atob('YWxlcnQoMSk='))) to bypass filters.

Delivery & Execution
Deploys exploits over Tor for anonymity.

Supports multi-threaded attacks for testing resilience.

Retries failed attempts with mutated payloads.

 Highlights
Scalability: Handles multiple targets concurrently with asyncio.

Robustness: Extensive error handling, retries, and logging.

Extensibility: Modular design for adding new vuln types or evasion techniques.
